# Personalized Movie Recommendation System

## Objective
Develop a recommendation system for movies based on user preferences. The system predicts movies tailored to the user by analyzing their past interactions and preferences using Collaborative and Content-Based Filtering techniques.

## Features
- Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on user behavior and interactions.
- Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies using metadata like genres, actors, and directors.
- Hybrid Model (Optional): Combines collaborative and content-based approaches for improved recommendations.

## Techniques Used
1. **Collaborative Filtering**
   - Matrix Factorization (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition - SVD).
   - Deep learning-based approaches (optional).
2. **Content-Based Filtering**
   - Vectorization of metadata using TF-IDF or one-hot encoding.
   - Similarity computations (e.g., cosine similarity).

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and metrics.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Advanced model building.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Flask/Django**: For web application development.

## Dataset
- **[MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)**
  - Contains millions of movie ratings and metadata.
  - Use the 100k or 1M version for faster iteration.
